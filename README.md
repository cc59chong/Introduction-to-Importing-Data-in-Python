# Introduction-to-Importing-Data-in-Python
learn the many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as `.txt` and `.csv`; from files native to other software such as `Excel spreadsheets`, `Stata`, `SAS`, and `MATLAB` files; and from relational databases such as `SQLite` and `PostgreSQL`.
## 1 -- Introduction and flat files
Learn how to import data into Python from all types of flat files, which are a simple and prevalent form of data storage.<br>
Learn how to use ```Numpy``` and `pandas` to import flat files and customize your imports.
## 2 -- Importing data from other file types
Learn how to import data into Python from a wide array of important file types. These include `pickled files`, `Excel spreadsheets`, `SAS` and `Stata files`, `HDF5 files`, a file type for storing `large quantities of numerical data`, and `MATLAB files`.
## 3 -- Working with relational databases in Python
Learn about relational models, how to create SQL queries, how to filter and order your SQL records, and how to perform advanced queries by joining database tables.
